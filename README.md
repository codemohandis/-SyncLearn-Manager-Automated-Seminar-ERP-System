# 🎓 SyncLearn Manager: Automated Seminar ERP System

**SyncLearn Manager** is a robust, modular automation suite designed for educational organizations. It bridges **Google Forms**, **Google Sheets**, and **Gmail** to create a self-managing registration and notification ecosystem. It ensures schedule integrity with "Time-Clash" detection and provides a hands-off experience for administrators.

## 🚀 System Architecture

The project is built on three pillars:

1. **Google Forms:** The front-end interface for student enrollment.
2. **Google Sheets:** The relational database (split into Registration and Master Seminar details).
3. **Google Apps Script:** The engine that processes logic, prevents clashes, and automates emails.

## 📊 Database Schema

### 1. Sheet: `Seminar Details`

This is your **Master Catalog**. The script reads this sheet to know when a seminar is happening and where to send students.

| Column | Header | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | Timestamp | Date/Time | Automatically generated. |
| **B** | SeminarID | String | Unique ID (e.g., `SEM-101`). |
| **C** | SeminarTitle | String | Full name of the session. |
| **D** | SeminarDate | Date | Format: `M/D/YYYY`. |
| **E** | Time | Time | Format: `HH:MM:SS AM/PM`. |
| **F** | Description | Text | Detailed syllabus or summary. |
| **G** | Duration | String | e.g., `2 Hours`. |
| **H** | **Status** | String | Set to `Upcoming`. Script changes it to `Completed`. |
| **I** | WhatsappGroupLink | URL | Link to the community group. |
| **J** | ZoomLink | URL | The virtual classroom link. |
| **K** | SeminarThumbnail | URL | Google Drive link for the banner image. |
| **L** | Speaker | String | Name of the instructor. |
| **M** | **Total Registered** | Integer | **Live Count** updated automatically by the script. |

### 2. Sheet: `Seminar Registrations`

This stores every student submission.

| Column | Header | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | Timestamp | Auto-generated by Form. |
| **B** | SeminarID | Selected by student via Dropdown. |
| **C** | Name | Participant's full name. |
| **D** | Email Address | Primary contact for confirmation. |
| **E** | Contact No | Phone/WhatsApp number. |
| **F** | School/Institute | Educational background. |
| **G** | City | Participant's location. |
| **H** | **IsEmail** | **Status Column:** `✅ Confirmed`, `⚠️ Duplicate`, or `❌ Time Clash`. |

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Form & Sheet Integration

* Create a Google Form with fields matching the `Seminar Registrations` sheet.
* Link the form to your Spreadsheet.
* Create a second tab named `Seminar Details` with the columns listed above.

### 2. Script Deployment

Go to **Extensions > Apps Script** and create the following modular files:

* `Config.gs`: Contains Sheet IDs and Global Constants.
* `Main.gs`: Handles the `onFormSubmit` logic.
* `Automations.gs`: Manages Reminders, Status Updates, and Registration Counters.
* `Helpers.gs`: Handles complex Date/Time parsing and Time-Clash logic.
* `ComposeHtml.gs`: The responsive Email template.

### 3. Trigger Configuration

You must set these manually in the **Triggers** (⏰ icon) section:

1. **`onFormSubmit`**: Select "From Spreadsheet" → "On form submit".
2. **`autoReminderTrigger`**: Select "Time-driven" → "Hour timer" → "Every hour".
3. **`updateSeminarStatus`**: Select "Time-driven" → "Day timer" → "1 AM to 2 AM".

## 🛡️ Smart Business Logic

### 🚫 Duplicate Prevention

The system allows one email to be used for multiple people (e.g., a parent registering two children). Registration is only flagged as a **Duplicate** if the **Email + Name + Seminar ID** are all identical.

### ⏳ Time-Clash Detection

The script calculates the exact timestamp of every seminar. If a user tries to register for a new seminar that overlaps with one they are already confirmed for, the system blocks the entry with a `❌ Time Clash` status to prevent over-booking.

### 📬 Performance Optimized Emails

Reminders are sent automatically ~1 hour before the start time. To prevent slow loading in Gmail, the system converts Google Drive links into **CDN-optimized links** for instant image rendering.
